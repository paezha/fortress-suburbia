	abstract = {Lower-income areas experience an increased incidence of traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths than more affluent ones. Researchers tend to blame these outcomes on differences in car ownership, with lower-income households expected to use vulnerable active modes at higher rates, as well as being more likely to drive older vehicles with fewer safety features. While these explanations seem plausible enough, they likely fail to provide a complete picture of the problem. This study examines the role of the built environment in road safety outcomes for lowerand higher-income block groups in Orange County, Florida. It finds that the hazard posed by urban arterials is three times greater for lower-income environments than for more affluent communities. Sidewalk buffers, ordinarily regarded as a pedestrian amenity, were associated with crash increases in affluent areas but not lowerincome ones. Areas with concentrations of black residents were found to be increased risk, even after accounting for differences in income. Considered as a whole, the risk factors for lower-income and high-income populations are not the same. This article examines the underlying reasons that lead to these outcomes and discusses the need to better account for the manner in which design may uniquely affect the safety of different demographic cohorts.},

	abstract = {Racist policies (such as redlining) create inequities in the built environment, producing racially and ethnically segregated communities, poor housing conditions, unwalkable neighborhoods, and general disadvantage. Studies on built environment disparities are usually limited to measures and data that are available from existing sources or can be manually collected.To use built environment indicators generated from online street-level images to investigate the association among neighborhood racial and ethnic composition, the built environment, and health outcomes across urban areas in the US.This cross-sectional study was conducted using built environment indicators derived from 164 million Google Street View images collected from November 1 to 30, 2019. Race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic data were obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates; health outcomes were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) data set. Multilevel modeling and mediation analysis were applied. A total of 59 231 urban census tracts in the US were included. The online images and the ACS data included all census tracts. The PLACES data comprised survey respondents 18 years or older. Data were analyzed from May 23 to November 16, 2022.Model-estimated association between image-derived built environment indicators and census tract (neighborhood) racial and ethnic composition, and the association of the built environment with neighborhood racial composition and health.The racial and ethnic composition in the 59 231 urban census tracts was 1 160 595 (0.4\%) American Indian and Alaska Native, 53 321 345 (19.5\%) Hispanic, 462 259 (0.2\%) Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 17 166 370 (6.3\%) non-Hispanic Asian, 35 985 480 (13.2\%) non-Hispanic Black, and 158 043 260 (57.7\%) non-Hispanic White residents. Compared with other neighborhoods, predominantly White neighborhoods had fewer dilapidated buildings and more green space indicators, usually associated with good health, and fewer crosswalks (eg, neighborhoods with predominantly minoritized racial or ethnic groups other than Black residents had 6\% more dilapidated buildings than neighborhoods with predominantly White residents). Moreover, the built environment indicators partially mediated the association between neighborhood racial and ethnic composition and health outcomes, including diabetes, asthma, and sleeping problems. The most significant mediator was non–single family homes (a measure associated with homeownership), which mediated the association between neighborhoods with predominantly minority racial or ethnic groups other than Black residents and sleeping problems by 12.8\% and the association between unclassified neighborhoods and asthma by 24.2\%.The findings in this cross-sectional study suggest that large geographically representative data sets, if used appropriately, may provide novel insights on racial and ethnic health inequities. Quantifying the impact of structural racism on social determinants of health is one step toward developing policies and interventions to create equitable built environment resources.},

	abstract = {This article examines the role of the street network in road safety outcomes. Data on more than 130 000 crashes occurring over 9 years in 24 medium-sized California cities was input into a geographic information system (GIS) and evaluated against principal measures of street network density and connectivity at the Census Block Group level. Few studies have taken this more comprehensive approach of looking at the complete street network when it comes to safety, partly because until now this kind of holistic assessment would have been very difficult without recent advances in research tools such as GIS. The results of this study suggest that street network characteristics do in fact play a role in road safety outcomes. Although the underlying factors contributing to this role are not yet known, our analysis showed safety outcomes to be associated with street network density. More specifically, our results indicate that the highest risk of fatal or severe crashes occurs with very low street network density and safety outcomes improve as the intersection density increases.

	abstract = {The number of pedestrian deaths from motor vehicle crashes in the U.S. has risen 59\% since 2009. Several studies have researched crash characteristics-such as the people, vehicles, and roadways involved-when examining this sharp increase. But where are these fatalities occurring and what spatial characteristics of these locations could be influencing this trend? We looked at pedestrian fatality data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System and socioeconomic, demographic, and built environment data from the U.S. Census and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Location Database for the study period of 1999-2020. After inputting the data into QGIS, we made graphs with 95\% confidence intervals to analyze longitudinal trends in crash location characteristics and created heat maps of pedestrian fatality locations in nine large U.S. cities to compare clustering in the beginning of the study period (1999-2002) with clustering at the end (2017-2020). The results of this study indicate that pedestrian fatalities are moving away from downtown areas (with a 63.0\% decrease in study cities' downtowns) and are now happening more in suburbs (a 32.1\% increase outside downtowns). Many of these suburbs are post-war suburbs that were built in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s and have low population and road densities and low levels of pedestrian commuting. Additionally, these fatalities are happening in neighborhoods with high proportions of minority residents, low educational attainment, and high poverty rates that are more than 60\% above the national average.},

Factors such as street characteristics, vehicle volumes, activity levels, income levels, and proximity to limited-access highways and the downtown area were controlled for. The results suggested that all three of the fundamental characteristics of a street network street connectivity, street network density, and street patterns were statistically significant in affecting the choice to drive, walk, bike, or take transit. Both increased intersection density and additional street connectivity were generally associated with more walking, biking, and transit use. Street patterns with gridded street networks, which tended to have a higher-than-average street connectivity and a much higher street network density, were associated with much more walking and biking. These results suggested that street network patterns were extremely important for encouraging nonautomobile modes of travel. As the United States begins to focus on reducing vehicle miles traveled as a strategy to combat carbon production and cut energy use, it is increasingly imperative that this relationship between the built environment and mode choice be accounted for in the planning and design of the transportation system.},

Multilevel models show that the number of suburban evictions has steadily risen over time, even as urban evictions have been stable. The cases of Cleveland, Seattle, and Tampa demonstrate that the increase in suburban evictions is concentrated in pockets of the suburbs.

	abstract = {Problem: When the First National Conference on City Planning took place in Washington, DC, 100 ago, the delegates failed to foresee the consequences of automobility and suburbanization, but in other ways they were remarkably prescient. They stressed the importance of the linkage between transportation and land use, understood that transportation facilities must be harmoniously embedded in the urban fabric, and viewed transportation investment as a way to direct growth, revitalize flagging areas, and link jobs and housing. Since transportation planners in subsequent decades kept this vision alive, envisioning a network of context-sensitive urban freeways fully integrated into the urban milieu, why is this not what was built? Purpose: We consider the history of U.S. urban transportation planning over the past 100 years, to explain the evolution and legacy of the single most important transportation development of the past century save automobility itself: the emergence of the urban freeway. Methods: We reviewed primary and secondary material, including plans, manuscripts, newspaper accounts, and scholarly articles and books. Results and conclusions: We argue that the method used to fund interstate highway development put federal and state highway engineers in charge, and this affected highways' location and design. State highway engineers imposed a narrow, traffic-service-oriented vision on metropolitan freeways that focused on maximizing vehicle throughput and largely ignored other urban concerns. With too little advance thought, overbuilt, sparse, ring-radial networks were routed through neighborhoods in cities around the country, often at great social and environmental cost. Though the system has undeniably conferred great benefits in terms of enhanced mobility, the costs have been high as well. Recent years have seen a return to the early planners' perspective, stressing the social, environmental, and aesthetic impacts of transportation facilities and interactions with land use. Takeaway for practice: A century-old vision of coordinated transportation and land use planning has resurfaced in practice, but in the meantime politically expedient decisions about public finance have had unanticipated, but profound and long-lasting effects on projects, travel, and urban form. Research support: Portions of this research were funded by the University of California Transportation Center and the University of California, Los Angeles Academic Senate.},

	abstract = {Social epidemiologists have drawn attention to health inequalities as avoidable and inequitable, encouraging thinking beyond proximal risk factors to the causes of the causes. However, key debates remain unresolved including the contribution of material and psychosocial pathways to health inequalities. Tools to operationalise social factors have not developed in tandem with conceptual frameworks, and research has often remained focused on the disadvantaged rather than on forces shaping population health across the distribution. Using the example of transport, we argue that closer attention to social processes (capital accumulation and motorisation) and social forms (commodity, corporation, and car) offers a way forward. Corporations tied to the car, primarily oil and vehicle manufacturers, are central to the world economy. Key drivers in establishing this hegemony are the threat of violence from motor vehicles and the creation of distance through the restructuring of place. Transport matters for epidemiology because the growth of mass car ownership is environmentally unsustainable and affects population health through a myriad of pathways. Starting from social forms and processes, rather than their embodiment as individual health outcomes and inequalities, makes visible connections between road traffic injuries, obesity, climate change, underdevelopment of oil producing countries, and the huge opportunity cost of the car economy. Methodological implications include a movement-based understanding of how place affects health and a process-orientated integration of material and psychosocial explanations that, while materially based, contests assumptions of automatic benefits from economic growth. Finally, we identify car and oil corporations as anti-health forces and suggest collaboration with them creates conflicts of interest.},

	abstract = {Road network congestion; a traffic state characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing; is a major issue in most urban areas around the globe. Building more roads is a commonly employed policy intervention to reduce congestion. This strategy, however, is controversial because under certain conditions road capacity expansions may induce growth in traffic volumes. A crucial precursor to understanding whether road capacity expansions provide a solution to congestion is to quantify the technology driving congestion in urban road networks. This congestion technology describes the variation in performance of the network, often represented by traffic flow through the road network, over its intensity of use given by the number of vehicles in the network. However, obtaining empirical estimates of congestion technology from data on traffic variables is challenging due to statistical biases that emerge via the complex interactions between traffic flow, traffic controls, and capacity. To adjust for such biases, this paper presents an approach based on causal statistical modelling to quantify the nature and form of congestion technology in road networks in twenty-four cities worldwide. Our results suggest that increasing network capacity is in general not an efficient solution to manage congestion, in the sense that the average travel speed in the network does not increase substantially with an increase in capacity. This result and our congestion technology estimates have important implications for optimal urban transportation strategies.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of the Interstate Highway System, constructed between 1950 and 1990 in the United States (US), on racial segregation. To provide causal estimates, I use the 1947 plan of the Interstate Highway System, a variant of the 1947 plan that connects city center pairs in this plan through shortest-distance and exploration routes in the 16th-19th century, as the instruments for actual highways built. Empirical results from census tracts in the US show that the construction of highways led to sorting along racial lines. I find strong evidence of heterogeneous effects based on the initial black population. I do not find any impact of highways on neighborhoods which have a lower share of initial black population. However, there is an increase in the share of the black population for neighborhoods located in close proximity to highways, and which have a higher share of the initial black population. This increase is driven by the white population moving out and black population moving into these neighborhoods. I demonstrate that whites that moved out of neighborhoods, now commute to work, made possible due to access provided by highways. These residents were on average better educated and had a higher income than the residents moving into the neighborhoods. The reasons for this movement are disamenities emanating from highways, and racial preferences for social interactions. Finally, I show that this relationship between highways and segregation is also observed at the aggregate level. Empirical estimates indicate that one new highway passing through the central city leads to 0.02 units increase in the dissimilarity index for the metropolitan area.},

	abstract = {This paper examines segregation in American cities from 1890 to 1990. From 1890 to 1940, ghettos were born as blacks migrated to urban areas and cities developed vast expanses filled with almost entirely black housing. From 1940 to 1970, black migration continued and the physical areas of the ghettos expanded. Since 1970, there has been a decline in segregation as blacks have moved into previously all-white areas of cities and suburbs. Across all these time periods there is a strong positive relation between urban population or density and segregation. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.},

	abstract = {This study examines the influence of social processes on the spatial distribution of residential lawns, one of the most prominent anthropogenic environmental challenges in US urban/suburban areas today. Specifically, we examine how three theoretically informed social drivers of urban vegetation patterns—population density, social stratification, and lifestyle behavior—explain two measures of residential lawns at the US Census block group (CBG) scale in suburban Boston, MA, USA. Using fine-spatial resolution (0.5m) remotely sensed data, we map land cover from which we generate two lawn measures: (1) “percent lawn cover,” which is the overall percentage of land in a CBG containing lawn, and (2) “percent lawn realized stewardship,” which is the percentage of non-developed land in a CBG containing lawn. We use spatial regression to find that population density and lifestyle behavior, proxied by percentage of single-family detached homes, average household size, and percentage of protected land in the CBG—are the key social processes driving the spatial distribution of both lawn measures in our study area. Results also show that spatial regression provides theoretical insight into additional, unspecified processes influencing the spatial distribution of lawns, net of the effects of the independent variables. These findings contribute to the existing understanding of the social processes influencing the residential lawn landscape, and are therefore useful for scientists, decision-makers, and stakeholders who are interested in moderating the potential social and ecological impacts of this landscape.},

	abstract = {The three decades from 1940 through 1970 mark a turning point in the spatial scale of Black–White residential segregation in the United States compared with earlier years. We decompose metropolitan segregation into three components: segregation within the city, within the suburbs, and between the city and its suburbs. We then show that extreme levels of segregation were well established in most cities by 1940, and they changed only modestly by 1970. In this period, changes in segregation were greater at the metropolitan scale, driven by racially selective population growth in the suburbs. We also examine major sources of rising segregation, including region, metropolitan total, and Black population sizes, and indicators of redlining in the central cities based on risk maps prepared by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the late 1930s. In addition to overall regional differences, segregation between the city and suburbs and within suburbia increased more in metropolitan areas with larger Black populations, but this relationship was found only in the North. In contrast to some recent theorizing, there is no association between preparation of an HOLC risk map or the share of city neighborhoods that were redlined and subsequent change in any component of segregation.},

The treatment effect is positively correlated with initial neighborhood income and negative for the poorest tracts.
