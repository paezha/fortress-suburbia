This is my first notebook. It will have some text and an example of code.

I am currently learning from [Geocomputation in R](https://r.geocompx.org/). I can copy some exercises from there.

But I will begin with a simple chunk of code that uses the built-in cars dataset.

This is a plot in base R:
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

This is a bibliographic reference: @dumbaugh_why_2022. I will add a bibliography at the end.
